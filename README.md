# 👋 Hello you! I'm Renato Vilella, DHSc!

Welcome to my GitHub corner! 🚀 I am a Doctor in Health Sciences and I'm a passionate programmer and AI Engineer from Brazil 🌍, and I thrive on turning coffee into code. ☕️

## 🔧 Technologies & Tools

- 💻 I'm proficient in HTML5, CSS, PHP (strong background with APIs), Python, C#, MLOps (from production to deployment and optmization ->> Prediction models, LLM, NLP, Computer Vision, and Neural Networks).
- 🌐 I pretty much like working with Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Autogluon, well... Data, AI-focused, MLOps libraries.
- 🛠 I enjoy blending possibilities and programming languages tailored to the project.

## 🌱 What I'm currently learning

I'm on a journey to master the development (or to archive some goals due the infinitude of possibilities) of AI Brains (intercomunicated AI's with proposal in health sciences). 🚀

## 💼 Professional Experience (most recent ones)

- 🌟 In the past year I've lead the development and participated in the research, as the Senior ML Engineer at Predictor Solutions Ltda, of a prediction (AI-Powered) system to be used in ICU's to predict diseases (80.4% accuracy), homeostasis status (93.2% accuracy), mortality risk, patient discharge time, and some other cool functions. The system was validated and is now deployed and at production level. 
- 🔭 I'm am one of the winners of Garmin x Labfront Women's Health Prize and I developed a project for Predictor Solutions Ltda to predict menstrual pain through vital signs colected from Garmin Smartwatches. Later I optmized the solution to any individual that want to take care of their health. It was a great challenge.
- In the past, I've contributed to many academics and companies with data science and data analysis work. I also worked as a hardware professional doing computer maintenance. I've worked as a Web Designer and WebApp developer (PHP, HTML5, CSS, MySQL), and created awesome websites and online course platforms (MOOC).

## 🚀 Goals for the Future

My future aspirations include working on other real health projects that can trully change the world and save lives/impact lives within robust market companies and/or engaging in research. I'm excited to think about the evolution and integration of Artificial Intelligence in Health Sciences!
